(defprotocol MethodCombination
  "A *method combination* defines the way applicable primary and auxiliary methods are combined into a single *effective
  method*. Method combinations also specify which auxiliary method *qualifiers* (e.g. `:before` or `:around`) are
  allowed, and how `defmethod` macro forms using those qualifiers are expanded (e.g., whether they get an implicit
  `next-method` arg)."
  (allowed-qualifiers [method-combination]
    "The set containing all qualifiers supported by this method combination. `nil` in the set means the method
  combination supports primary methods (because primary methods have no qualifier); all other values refer to auxiliary
  methods with that qualifier, e.g. `:before`, `:after`, or `:around`.

  ```clj
  (allowed-qualifiers (clojure-method-combination)) ;-> #{nil}
  (allowed-qualifiers (clos-method-combination))    ;-> #{nil :before :after :around}
  (allowed-qualifiers (doseq-method-combination))   ;-> #{:doseq}

  into a single effective method. Method includes effective `^:dispatch-value` metadata.")

  (transform-fn-tail [method-combination qualifier fn-tail]
    "Make appropriate transformations to the `fn-tail` of a [[methodical.macros/defmethod]] macro expansion for a
  primary method (qualifier will be `nil`) or an auxiliary method. You can use this method to add implicit args like
  `next-method` to the body of a `defmethod` macro. (Because this method is invoked during macroexpansion, it should
  return a Clojure form.)"))

    "Add an auxiliary method implementation for `qualifier` (e.g. `:before`) and `dispatch-value`. Unlike primary

    existing methods for this dispatch value.")

  (remove-aux-method ^methodical.interface.MethodTable [method-table qualifier dispatch-val method]
    "Remove an auxiliary method from a method table. Because multiple auxiliary methods are allowed for the same

    In the future, I hope to fix this by storing unique identifiers in the metadata of methods in the map."))
