Thanks for contributing to Methodical. Before open a pull request, please take a moment to:

- [ ] Ensure the PR follows the [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide).
- [ ] Tests and linters pass. You can run all of the tests and linters locally with

      ./scripts/lint-and-test.sh

    GitHub Actions will also run these same tests against your PR.
- [ ] Make sure you've included new tests for any new features or bugfixes.
- [ ] New features are documented, or documentation is updated appropriately for any changed features.
- [ ] Carefully review your own changes and revert any superfluous ones. (A good example would be moving words in the
      Markdown documentation to different lines in a way that wouldn't change how the rendered page itself would
      appear. These sorts of changes make a PR bigger than it needs to be, and, thus, harder to review.)

      Of course, indentation and typo fixes are not covered by this rule and are always appreciated.
- [ ] Include a detailed explanation of what changes you're making and why you've made them. This will help me
      understand what's going on while we review it.

Once you've done all that, open a PR! Thanks for your contribution!
